we want to write a cli program that sends the email to the applicants. the applicants are stored in the applicants model

the emails wil be send using nodemailer 
the email templates are constructed using the react email 
the cli will use commander
we can select the template by name
a user can be sent multiple emails
keep the email logs in a database, one applicnat can be sent multiple emails
there is no need to add a scheduler, emails are sent to the pending applicants when the script runs

parameters of the script are -l --limit
- t --template-name
- c --country (optional)

please create a plan for this and ask me any questions regarding the packages or else
