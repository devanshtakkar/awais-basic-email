cli tool that takes the excel file
parses it via the xlxs library and save it to the local data base


upload the excel file/parses data 
make an express endpoint in this repo that saves that data


then send the emails via smtp
https://ethereal.email/create for testing SMTP

so not send the email to the same person again.

we add the path to the file in cli tools


now what i want you to do is :
1. a cli tool that take the excel file present in the repo,  read its content through path or whatever 
 2 Parses it via xlxs library and save it to the local database dev.db, for uploading the exxcel file parsed data , make an express endpoint in the repo that saves the data
3 then send the emails via smtp 
4 I dont want to send email to the same person again whom i have alread sent it one , so make a check for that too

carefully read the instruction i gave you , the cuttent code strucutre and do the tasks accordingly

if you need anything from me , do asks me
